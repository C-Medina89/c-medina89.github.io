##  About Me

I completed the **Nortcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp**, an intensive,
industry-led programme designed to prepare graduates for real-world data roles.

During the bootcamp, I worked on individual and team-based projects using
modern data tools and workflows, including:
- End-to-end data pipelines
- Cloud-based data storage
- Machine learning models
- Agile development and pair programming
- Version control and testing best practices

I’m particularly interested in roles involving **data pipelines, analytics,
and machine learning systems**.
